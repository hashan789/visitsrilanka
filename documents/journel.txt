<p>Every child, young and adult in the world is accustomed to visiting zoos for their enjoyment and happiness. 
In some zoos around the world, animals are kept in cages not only for exhibit but also for the protection of 
as well as for breeding purposes. The majority of these animals are considered as endangered animals according
to the Red Data Book. In that sense, the establishment of zoos is a great help to the future survival of some 
animals, but zoologists have even accepted that it may be a matter of great concern that this is a major 
to animals in terms of cruelty and persecution. In my opinion, animals are not an exhibit in zoos but a unique 
creation of the nature. In some cases, zoos can also be seen as centre of pioneering the survival of animal 
communities. But in comparison, there are very few such zoos in the world. Although such zoos have been praised 
by some zoologists, that praise are now relatively low level in the world. It is a matter of inquiry as to the 
advantages and disadvantages of keeping animals in the cages of the zoos for the future survival of the species.</p>

<h2>What are the disadvantages to animals?</h2><br>
<ul>
   <li>Nowadays, people are less interested in visiting zoos, but which can be taken as a positive factor. 
    This is because of the awareness gained by people on social media about the despicable acts of cruelty in 
    zoos and the indiscriminate killing of sick animals.</li>

    <li>Imprisonment animals in zoos has deprived them of their right to live in a free environment, 
    which in turn has had a profound effect on their lifestyle. Such animals may be more prone to mental
     illness due to physical and mental deprivation and stress.</li>


  <li>Because of Spending some animals alone in prisons ,there exist a more probability of having stress.
   As a result, these animals are more susceptible to social ills. Today, such incidents are common in some
    zoos around the world. in addition to that,They lose the ability to satisfy their sexual needs.</li>

  <li>Animals in some zoos may also suffer from eye diseases due to inadequate sun exposure. And also,
   it is more susceptible to physical ailments due to their monotonous diet, irregular feeding habits, 
   and inadequate feeding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the benefits to animals?</h2><br>
 <ul>
   <li>But some zoos are a big help to some animals in their future survival. So for this, endangered 
   animals are special. Factors such as declining population density and declining breeding progeny have
    led to further improvements. Endangered pandas living in China and the cola bear in Australia occupy
     a special place. Zoos can be described as a pioneer in advancing their species by studying their way of life.</li>

   <li>Animals have to face to various diseases in their lifestyle. Necessary treatment should be found 
   for such diseases. Zoos do a great service for that. Zoos are also required to provide special treatment
    for each species. In addition, zoos are of great help in studying previously unrecognized diseases in 
    animals. It can sometimes be a great service to a particular animal community. And this will also
     help to avoid severe impacts on the lives of the animal community.</li>

<div class="col-8" style="margin-left:5%;"><p>In this case, keeping animals in cages in zoos can be considered as a violation of the rights of the 
animal community. Humans as well as animals should have the right to live freely, and it is shown that 
many zoos have taken away that right. But it is unforgettable to note that some zoos play a vital role
 in the survival of many species.</p></div>
